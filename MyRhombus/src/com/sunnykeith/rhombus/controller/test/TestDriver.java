/**
 * This is to demonstrate mastery of my development skills and concepts such as
 * developing simple classes with instance variables, constructors, accessor(getter),
 * mutator(setter). The use of mathematical operator, console output, user input,
 * data conversion and application of java best practices, such as class/package structure,
 * javadoc comments, appropriate identifier names, proper indenting and the use of the "this"
 * keyword.
 * The second part of my Rhombus project is to add functionalities to existing class. And to 
 * demonstrate code reuse by calling existing methods to more functions
 * The third part of Rhombus project will allow users the ability to create a Rhombus by using their own
 * values for (xAxis, yAxis), vertical and horizontal lengths in an interactive application.
